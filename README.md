# Battery Monitoring System
## Project Overview
Welcome to the Battery Monitoring System project, a robust solution designed to monitor the status of a large number of batteries simultaneously. This project features three key components: the Master board, datalogger board, and current sensing board, working in tandem to ensure comprehensive battery monitoring.

## Key Features
Master Board: The central hub of the system, the Master board is responsible for collecting data from the datalogger and current sensing boards. It then transmits this data to a PC for real-time monitoring and analysis.

Datalogger Board: The datalogger board is equipped to monitor the voltage and temperature of individual battery lines. With 20 lines, each capable of gathering data from a single battery, as well as two temperature sensors, this board offers detailed insights into battery performance.

Current Sensing Board: This board calculates the overall current of the charging pack, providing valuable information for monitoring battery health and performance.

Scalability: The project is designed to accommodate a substantial number of batteries, with 30 datalogger boards capable of simultaneous monitoring. It is a scalable solution suitable for various applications.

Data Accuracy: The Battery Monitoring System ensures accurate and reliable battery status monitoring, contributing to optimal battery performance and safety.
